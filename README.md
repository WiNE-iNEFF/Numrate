**NumRate** is a compact desktop application in Python (PySide2) for viewing current exchange rates. The project is inspired by the interfaces of crypto exchanges and banking platforms, with a focus on convenience, scalability and support for multiple data sources. At the moment, the application receives data from the website of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NB RB), providing a simple and convenient interface for viewing the cost of currencies pegged to the Belarusian ruble.
